Baptiste, french student in computer science. </br>
Currently following a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at : ISIMA INP, Aubi√®re, France
Last diploma : 2-years university technical diploma at Universit√© Clermont-Auvergne, Aubi√®re, France. </br>
Great sports enthusiast. High level tennis practice for 11 years and football for 12 years. But for 4 years now, I have taken a
passion for bodybuilding, which has allowed me to acquire a thorough knowledge of the human body: its reaction to muscular
work, and the nutritionnecessary for its proper functioning. Outside of sports, I am very interested in fashion, especially
independent brands, because they are real examples of entrepreneurship and creativity.
